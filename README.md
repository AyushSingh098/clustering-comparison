# Comparison of Major Clustering Approaches
• Partitioning approach:
	– Typical methods: k-means, k-medoids, CLARANS, k-Nearest Neighbors

• Hierarchical approach:
	– Typical methods: Diana, Agnes, BIRCH, CAMELEON

• Density-based approach:
	– Typical methods: DBSACN, OPTICS, DenClue

• Grid-based approach:
	– Typical methods: STING, WaveCluster, CLIQUE

• Model-based:
	– Typical methods: EM, SOM, COBWEB

• Frequent pattern-based:
	– Typical methods: p-Cluster

• User-guided or constraint-based:
	– Typical methods: COD (obstacles), constrained clustering

• Link-based clustering:
	– Massive links can be used to cluster objects: SimRank, LinkClus
